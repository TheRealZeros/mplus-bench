Overriding dtype=None with `dtype=torch.float16` due to requirements of `bitsandbytes` to enable model loading in 8-bit or 4-bit. Pass your own dtype to specify the dtype of the remaining non-linear layers or pass dtype=torch.float16 to remove this warning.

All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing LlamaForCausalLM.

All the weights of LlamaForCausalLM were initialized from the model checkpoint at meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use LlamaForCausalLM for predictions without further training.

The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].
- `temperature`: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `temperature` is set to `0.0` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `temperature`.
- `top_p`: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `top_p` is set to `0.9` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `top_p`.
If you're using a pretrained model, note that some of these attributes may be set through the model's `generation_config.json` file.
